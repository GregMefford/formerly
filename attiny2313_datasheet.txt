ATtiny2313 8-bit microcontroller

SYMBOL	PARAMETER					CONDITION			MIN.	TYP.	MAX.		UNITS
VIL		Input Low Voltage except	VCC = 1.8V - 2.4V	-0.5			0.2VCC		V
		XTAL 1 and RESET_n pin		VCC = 2.4V - 5.5V	-0.5
                                                                        
VIH		Input High-voltage except	VCC = 1.8V - 2.4V	0.7VCC			VCC + 0.5	V
		XTAL1 and RESET pins		VCC = 2.4V - 5.5V	0.6V(3)
                                                                        
ICC		Power Supply Current		Idle 1MHz, VCC = 2V			0.08	0.2			mA

Here is some more columnar stuff with different columns just for demonstration:

This is a header	that happens to	match the content	columns
This is some		columnar text	that acts like		a table
when you expand		all the tabs	into spaces,		which
I have already		done for this	example just to		make it
easier				to read and		follow				along

This header obviously does not match up with the content
This			is a		smaller		table
designed to		demonstrate	that is can	find
two different	tables with	different	dimensions
